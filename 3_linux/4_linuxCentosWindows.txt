sudo gives power to a normal user to execute commands which is owned b root user.
-> if user has already full sudoers privilege, it can become a root user anytime.
    -> sudo -i       changes from normal user to root user.
                        -> only user in /etc/sudoers file or /etc/sudoers.d dir can use sudo -i command to switch 
                           to root user.

-> if user does not want to enter its password after running sudo command then:
      -> Add NOPASSWD option in users entry in sudoers file as specified below
          username ALL =(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

->  if a normal user wants to run root commands and Admin cannot share root password as per compliance, then possible solution is : ask admin to add your username in sudoers file.



------- software management --------------

net se ek link copy kari usko linux shelll mai
      curl <link> -o <desiredFilename>                         lika to wo net se download hone lagi..

-> tree command pehle se nahi tha to online install kara and then tree ab use kiya to saari directory tree format 
mai show hone lagi...

linux mai kaafi baar dependency waala issue aata hai ...let's say you want to install httpd package....
but to run it properly serveral other packages need to be install altogeher with it....
in that case it is better to use the 
                             yum install <packageName>

backward slash laga ke single hi link ko do line mai likh diya....

jenkins install karne ke liye official repository padhi 

kucch command likh uske aage hyphen y likh diya matlab meri taraf se ha hai ..no more further questions please..

yum grouplist               list all available group packages.
yum groupinstall <groupName>              installs all the packages in a group.
yum repolist                          list enabled yum repositories.

--- to install single package in redhat and debian OS
       ->   rpm -i packagename   in redHat os
      -> dpkg -i packagename in debian os



rpm -ivh <desiredFileName>               install karo magar human readable format mai saath ke saath cheeje print bhi karo..


where are yum repos and apt files located?
        /etcyum.repos.d/      for repos
        /etc/apt/sources.list & /etc/apt/sources.list.d         for apt

before installing package in ubuntu with apt command, we should run  
        apt update
     to refresh apt repository index.

-> what is the command to download a filer from internet over a network.
       wget URL
      curl URL -o outputfile




-------- services --------------
kisi bhi service ko start / stop karne ke liye systemctl command ka use kiya....

systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd

systemctl restart httpd
systemctl reload httpd

systemctl is active httpd              stauts baa deaga
systemctl is -enabled httpd

start karke then enable kar diya to service will run and comes up after reboot.


jaise windows mai aapka task manager mai saari cpu utilisation dikh jaati hai ... similarly aapka linux mai
      top 
   command bas likh do issey saara pid user pr ni virt res shr s %cpu %mem time + command sab tabular format mai show kar dega...




ps aux                            same top ki tarah saara ssaaman dikha ke quit kar dega...
ps -ef                             yaha parent process id bhi shorw kar dega....

ps -ef pipe grep httpd                                      issey saare httpd wale preocesses aa jaenge...

process ko kill karne ke liye 
            kill 1420 
            issey 1420 wala process pehle apne child ko kill karega then khud ko bhi kill kar lega...


kill -9 1476 
      issey 1476 id waala parent process forcefully kill ho jaega but ab uske child orphan process ban gaye...


ab inko kill karne ke liye aap
 ps -ef pipe grep httpd pipe grep -v `grep` pipe awk `{print $2}' pipe  xargs kill -9

ideal ko kill all the orphan processes...
reboot your linux system ko kill all the orphan processes...

kill -9 PID command is to stop process forcefully and kill PID is to stop process gracefully, child processes also
will be stopped if parent process is stopped gracefully...

-> a child process that remains running even after its parent process is terminated or completed without 
waiting for the child process execution is called a orphan process. zombie process that has completed its task but still, it shows an entry in a process table.


------ tar command ka use karke file ko archive kara...--------------

tar -czvf jenkins_06122020.tar.gz

c = compression
z = gunZip
v = verbose
f = file

---- let's say ab extract karna hai to.. you can extract by....

tar -xzvf jenkins_06122020.tar.gz 

x  = extract

----- another method is zip command ---
first install using 

yum install zip unzip -y


then after installation type 
zip -r jenkins_06122020.zip jenkins

history daba ke history bhi dekh li...
